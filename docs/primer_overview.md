# EMAC PRIMER overview

This repository focuses on the EMAC PRIMER trainer in a common upgraded configuration:

- ROM: 0000–7FFF
- RAM: 8000–FFFF
- Timekeeper RAM/RTC: **M48T35** (or compatible) providing battery-backed SRAM + RTC
- 6-digit 7-seg driven via EMOS/MOS display services

The included demos are aimed at being easy to study and modify, with heavy comments and clean structure.
